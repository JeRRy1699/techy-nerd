<h2> Here you will find some of medical based Ngo's tied up to us.</h2>
<p> You can directly visit their page and check out.</p> <br />
<p> They are as follows :</p> <br />

 <a href="https://snehamumbai.org"> Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA)  </a> :- <br />
We build replicable, evidence-based solutions with communities, governments and public health systems to improve health <br />
outcomes of vulnerable urban women and children.

A continuum of care means working with women and children from birth to adulthood in order to break the intergenerational cycle of poor health. <br />
Gender-based violence cuts across all stages along the continuum of care. <br />
We aim to ensure they have continuous access to and awareness of the health services <br />
they need to live a healthy and safe life. <br />

<br />

<a href="https://www.niramaya.org/">  Niramaya Health Foundation </a>

     Niramaya Health Foundation is a non-profit and non-government organization started in June 2001 in Mumbai for improving health of the communities it serves. <br />
     Niramaya was conceptualized even before that, in 1999, to tackle commonly found ‘Micronutrient Deficiencies’ in preschool children. <br />
     Originally an endeavor of Pratham Mumbai Education Initiative to improve the health of balwadi (pre-school) children, Niramaya took shape and came into existence. <br />
     Since Niramaya’s inception the healthcare activities have broadened beyond child health and nutrition to good health for all. <br />
     Niramaya has also expanded the range of the healthcare activities from curative to preventive and promotive care. <br />
     Niramaya believes in carrying out cost effective, measurable and sustainable health care projects and programs for marginalized communities. <br />
